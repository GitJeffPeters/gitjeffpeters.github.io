# Horizontal stab

Began riveting skins on stab. Started with nose ribs, forward spar, and in spar ribs up to stiffener. Got fist smiley where gun either slipped or was too close to spar. Also bent over one rivet and had to drill out. Otherwise very happy with results. About half way done with skin.
