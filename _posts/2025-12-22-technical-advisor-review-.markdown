summary: "Met with John Andre for a technical review of my work so far from the EAA. John spent an hour with me going over my assemblies to date and answered very valuable questions on the overall process along with paperwork and procedures. 

Visit:  Initial

Date of Inspection:  12/22/2025

Name:  John Andre,  EAA#:  578155

Chapter#:  339

Phone:  757-377-5888

Visit Comments/Activity Information:

The initial inspection covered the first 100 hours (approx.) of the RV-10 empennage kit.  Several subassemblies were completed, and others were well underway, offering good examples of the builder’s typical workmanship results and methods.

Discussions included:

-          Rivet evaluation: accidental use of the next size longer rivet does not necessarily require drill out and replacement with an “Oops Rivet” if the shop head is square and the diameter meets gauge inspection requirements.  Bent over shop heads with the end of the dimple hole exposed should be replaced.

-          Primer application – a heavy mist coat is sufficient.

-          Familiarity with Service Bulletins and working remedies into the initial assembly.

-          Use of local EAA Chapter resources, i.e., local builders with RV-10/14 build experience, local builders with Garmin, AFS/Dynon, GRT experience, etc.

-          When to contact DAR?  Some recommend it before building starts.  Given your experience and the established quality of the kit, I think this might be overkill.  That said, the mandatory final inspection happens much later, just before the first flight.  It's best to connect with them months before completion to avoid delays with the final Airworthiness Certificate (AWC).  I recommend 6 – 12 months prior, or anytime you have a build process, or FAA Airworthiness process-related question that is not answered to your satisfaction.  We have had good results working with Darrel Watson from Culpepper, VA.  Cell 303-261-2180.
-          Technical Counselor Project Visit frequency.  You can be the judge of this.  Initially, every 3 months may be sufficient, or whenever you desire an extra set of eyes.  Familiarity with the process will lengthen the period between visits.  Towards the end of the project, the complexity of assemblies will dictate more frequent visits.

Overall, the project is proceeding at a good pace, and workmanship is well above average.  Don’t hesitate to contact me via email if you have questions or if you desire to schedule a visit.
