summary: "Wrapped up the tail cone today which completes all the major assemblies of the empennage kit including VS, HS, Elevators, Rudder, and Tail cone. Overall I’m extremely pleased with the out come and quality of the project so far. There have been limited rivets requiring replacement and 2 oops dimples that were addressed. So far two parts required replacing but it’s all been a great learning experience. Moving forward with the wing kit I’ll want to really focus on my edge finishing on skins to get them to a true polish instead of just knocked down.
