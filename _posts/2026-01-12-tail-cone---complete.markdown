summary: "Completed tail cone final assembly with the exception of the two top skins. I’m leaving them aft one off for now mainly just in case I need to do any wiring/cabling in the tail where it will make it easier without having the skin on. I don’t expect the skin to take a significant amount of time to rivet on once I absolutely need to. The forward top skin gets riveted on when attached to the fuselage. Autumn helped today to get the bottom skins done. "

# Tail Cone - Complete!

Completed tail cone final assembly with the exception of the two top skins. I’m leaving them aft one off for now mainly just in case I need to do any wiring/cabling in the tail where it will make it easier without having the skin on. I don’t expect the skin to take a significant amount of time to rivet on once I absolutely need to. The forward top skin gets riveted on when attached to the fuselage. Autumn helped today to get the bottom skins done.
