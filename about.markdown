I've decided to do something I had planned on putting off until retirement a little bit early. I figured if I start building now, it'll be done well before retirement and I get many more years of use out of. With the reality that our kids will soon be out of the house and likel spread out across the East coast, we wanted the means to quickly go see them whenever we wanted. I decided on a [Vans][vans] RV-10 because of them being a leader in the kit marketspace and proven platform that fits out mission. We wanted a true 4-place to be able to carry plenty of cargo or the occasional 3/4 passengers. 

My plan for the build as of today, and extremely likely to change along the way is:
RV-10 Slow build kit
Lycoming  IO-540
Whirlwind 300 3-blade composite prop
GRT Avionics Package
Garmin Navigator
Autopilot
Air Conditioning
